{'debate': u'12', 'candidate': u'TRUMP', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u"As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia. I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you. I mean, for Russia, that doesn't mean I'm endorsing Putin."}}
{'debate': u'11', 'candidate': u'TRUMP', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u' Let me just tell you, first of all, Ive been hearing this man so long talking about Putin. Putin said about me  I didnt say about Putin  Putin said very nice things about me. And I say very nicely, wouldnt it be nice if actually we could get along with Russia, we could get along with foreign countries, instead of spending trillions and trillions of dollars?'}}
{'debate': u'05', 'candidate': u'BUSH', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u"... imagine what it's going to be like dealing with Putin or dealing with President Xi."}}
{'debate': u'11', 'candidate': u'TRUMP', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u' I think Id get along very well with Vladimir Putin. I just think so.'}}
{'debate': u'04', 'candidate': u'BUSH', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u"...voids are filled, and the idea that it's a good idea for Putin to be in Syria, let ISIS take out Assad, and then Putin will take out ISIS? I mean, that's like a board game, that's like playing Monopoly or something. That's not how the real world works."}}
{'debate': u'02', 'candidate': u'TRUMP', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u'I will get along - I think - with Putin, and I will get along with others, and we will have a much more stable - stable world.'}}
{'debate': u'1', 'candidate': u'SANDERS', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat negative', 'text': u'Well, I think Mr. Putin is going to regret what he is doing. I think that when he gets into that...'}}
{'debate': u'02', 'candidate': u'FIORINA', 'sentences': {'category': u'neutral', 'text': u"Having met Vladimir Putin, I wouldn't talk to him at all. We've talked way too much to him."}}
{'debate': u'04', 'candidate': u'TRUMP', 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u"But, if Putin wants to go and knocked the hell out of ISIS, I am all for it, 100%, and I can't understand how anybody would be against it..."}}
{'debate': u'5', 'candidate': u'SANDERS', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u'I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.'}}
{'debate': u'02', 'candidate': u'RUBIO', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u"Well, first of all, I have an understanding of exactly what it is Russia and Putin are doing, and it's pretty straightforward. He wants to reposition Russia, once again, as a geopolitical force."}}
{'debate': u'04', 'candidate': u'CARSON', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u'And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way.'}}
{'debate': u'04', 'candidate': u'FIORINA', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u"One of the reasons I've said that I would not be talking to Vladimir Putin right now, although I have met him as well, not in a green room for a show, but in a private meeting."}}
{'debate': u'04', 'candidate': u'RUBIO', 'sentences': {'category': u'neutral', 'text': u"Vladimir Putin is exploiting that weakness, for purposes of edging the Americans out as the most important geopolitical power broker in the region. And we do have a vested interest. And here's why."}}
{'debate': u'02', 'candidate': u'PAUL', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u'I think that really goes to really the judgment. Do we want someone with that kind of character, that kind of careless language to be negotiating with Putin? Do we want someone like that to be negotiating with Iran?'}}
{'debate': u'02', 'candidate': u'FIORINA', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u'Russia is a bad actor, but Vladimir Putin is someone we should not talk to, because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side, and we have all of that within our control.'}}
{'debate': u'07', 'candidate': u'CARSON', 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u'I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country- oil and energy. And we ought to fight them on that level.'}}
{'debate': u'12', 'candidate': u'KASICH', 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u"We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you're either with us or you're against us. We're not rattling a sword. You're not our enemy but we're not going to put up with this nonsense any longer."}}
{'debate': u'1', 'candidate': u"O'MALLEY", 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u"Anderson, Snowden put a lot of Americans' lives at risk. Snowden broke the law. Whistleblowers do not run to Russia and try to get protection from Putin. If he really believes that, he should be back here."}}
{'debate': u'01', 'candidate': u'WALKER', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat negative', 'text': u"And -- and that has put our national security at risk. If I am president, he won't think about that. You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage you probe with bayonets. When you find mush, you push. When you find steel, you stop."}}
{'debate': u'1', 'candidate': u'CLINTON', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u'Well, first of all, we got a lot of business done with the Russians when Medvedev was the president, and not Putin. We got a nuclear arms deal, we got the Iranian sanctions, we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in Afghanistan.'}}
{'debate': u'05', 'candidate': u'CHRISTIE', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat negative', 'text': u'See, maybe -- maybe because I\'m from New Jersey, I just have this kind of plain language hangup. But I would make very clear -- I would not talk to Vladimir Putin. In fact, I would talk to Vladimir Putin a lot. But I\'d say to him, "Listen, Mr. President, there\'s a no-fly zone in Syria; you fly in, it applies to you." And yes, we would shoot down the planes of Russian pilots if in fact they were stupid enough to think that this president was the same feckless weakling that the president we have in the Oval Office is right now.'}}
{'debate': u'11', 'candidate': u'KASICH', 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u'In Russia, we need to tell them were going to arm the Ukrainians with defensive lethal weapons. And were going to tell Putin if you attack anybody in Eastern Europe in NATO, you attack Finland and Sweden, which is not in NATO, consider it an attack on us. And he will understand that.'}}
{'debate': u'4', 'candidate': u'CLINTON', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u"And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but we've got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East."}}
{'debate': u'02', 'candidate': u'FIORINA', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u"What I would do, immediately, is begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet, I would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in Poland, I would conduct regular, aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states. I'd probably send a few thousand more troops into Germany. Vladimir Putin would get the message. By the way, the reason it is so critically important that every one of us know General Suleimani's name is because Russia is in Syria right now, because the head of the Quds force traveled to Russia and talked Vladimir Putin into aligning themselves with Iran and Syria to prop up Bashar al- Assad."}}
{'debate': u'05', 'candidate': u'FIORINA', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u"I didn't say I would cut off all communication with Putin. What I said was as president of the United States, now is not the time to talk with him. Reagan walked away at Reykjavik. There is a time and a place for everything. There is a time and a place for talk. And there is a time and a place for action."}}
{'debate': u'12', 'candidate': u'TRUMP', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u" And strong doesn't mean good. Putin is a strong leader, absolutely. I could name many strong leaders. I could name very many very weak leaders. But he is a strong leader. Now I don't say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact."}}
{'debate': u'1', 'candidate': u"O'MALLEY", 'sentences': {'category': u'neutral', 'text': u"Secretary Clinton, Russia, they're challenging the U.S. in Syria. According to U.S. intelligence, they've lied about who they're bombing. You spearheaded the reset with Russia. Did you underestimate the Russians, and as president, what would your response to Vladimir Putin be right now in Syria?"}}
{'debate': u'02', 'candidate': u'TRUMP', 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u'I believe that I will get along - we will do - between that, Ukraine, all of the other problems, we won\'t have the kind of problems that our country has right now with Russia and many other nations. TAPPER: Senator Rubio, you\'ve taken a very different approach to the - the question of Russia. You\'ve called Vladimir Putin a, quote, "gangster."'}}
{'debate': u'06', 'candidate': u'CHRISTIE', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat negative', 'text': u'This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?'}}
{'debate': u'02', 'candidate': u'PAUL', 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u"I think this goes back to essentially what we've been saying for the last two or three questions. Carly Fiorina also said we're not going to talk with Putin. Well, think if Reagan had said that during the Cold War? We continued to talk with the Russians throughout the Cold War which is much more significant that where we are now."}}
{'debate': u'04', 'candidate': u'RUBIO', 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u"I need to add a couple of points to this. The first is, I've never met Vladimir Putin, but I know enough about him to know he is a gangster. He is basically an organized crime figure that runs a country, controls a $2 trillion economy. And is using to build up his military in a rapid way despite the fact his economy is a disaster."}}
{'debate': u'1', 'candidate': u'CLINTON', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u"And, to -- provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of Syria at the rate they are. And, I think it's important too that the United States make it very clear to Putin that it's not acceptable for him to be in Syria creating more chaos, bombing people on behalf of Assad, and we can't do that if we don't take more of a leadership position, which is what I'm advocating."}}
{'debate': u'1', 'candidate': u'CLINTON', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat negative', 'text': u"There's no doubt that when Putin came back in and said he was going to be President, that did change the relationship. We have to stand up to his bullying, and specifically in Syria, it is important -- and I applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the Russians to make it clear that they've got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict."}}
{'debate': u'04', 'candidate': u'FIORINA', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u'...and I might also put in a few more thousand troops into Germany, not to start a war, but to make sure that Putin understand that the United States of America will stand with our allies. That is why Governor Bush is correct. We must have a no fly zone in Syria because Russia cannot tell the United States of America where and when to fly our planes. We also have a set of allies...'}}
{'debate': u'11', 'candidate': u'RUBIO', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u'Heres the bottom line. And Im going to repeat it again. The world today is as complicated and as complex as it has been certainly in a very  certainly in the lifetime of anybody here today. You indeed do have a lunatic in North Korea with nuclear weapons. You indeed do have the Chinese government taking over the most important shipping lane in the world. And Vladimir Putin, who youve expressed admiration for, Donald...'}}
{'debate': u'07', 'candidate': u'CARSON', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u'But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy. Seventy percent of our population lives bi-coastally). What about hydroelectric power? We can develop that, you know? We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.'}}
{'debate': u'04', 'candidate': u'TRUMP', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u"China is a problem, both economically in what they're doing in the South China Sea, I mean, they are becoming a very, very major force. So, we have more than just Russia. But, as far as the Ukraine is concerned, and you could Syria -- as far as Syria, I like -- if Putin wants to go in, and I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes, we were stablemates, and we did very well that night."}}
{'debate': u'05', 'candidate': u'CARSON', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u'We can capitalize upon that. You know, we should use our economic power in lots of different ways. I think we can use that in order to keep Putin contained, because he is a one-horse show. Energy. And we have an abundance of energy, but we have archaic energy exportation rules. We need to get rid of those, allow ourselves to really make Europe dependent on us and other parts of the world dependent on us for energy. Put him back in his little box where he belongs.'}}
{'debate': u'4', 'candidate': u'CLINTON', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u'When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down. And in fact, accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.'}}
{'debate': u'09', 'candidate': u'BUSH', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u"So the very basic fact is that Vladimir Putin's not gonna be an ally of the United States. The whole world knows this. It's a simple, basic fact. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) They're not taking out-- they're not-- they're not even attempting to take out ISIS. They're-- they're attacking the troops that we're supporting. we need to create a coalition, Sunni-led coalition on the ground, with our special operators to destroy ISIS and bring about stability. And you can't do that with Assad in power."}}
{'debate': u'04', 'candidate': u'FIORINA', 'sentences': {'category': u'somewhat positive', 'text': u"One of the reasons I've said I wouldn't be talking to Vladimir Putin right now is because we are speaking to him from a position of weakness brought on by this administration, so, I wouldn't talk to him for awhile, but, I would do this. I would start rebuilding the Sixth Fleet right under his nose, rebuilding the military -- the missile defense program in Poland right under his nose. I would conduct very aggressive military exercises in the Baltic States so that he understood we would protect our NATO allies..."}}
{'debate': u'07', 'candidate': u'CARSON', 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u"Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down. And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region. I think we need to put in some armored brigades there. We only have one or two. We need much more than that. We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania. They're terrified by the saber rattling. I think we ought to put in our missile defense system."}}
{'debate': u'6', 'candidate': u'SANDERS', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u' Well, this is what I would say. It is a complicated relationship. I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement. As youve indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed  men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country  their own country - - it is unspeakable. It is a real horror. Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But lets be clear: Russias aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO  correctly, I believe  are saying, you know what, were going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and hes trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.'}}
{'debate': u'05', 'candidate': u'CHRISTIE', 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u"They need to understand that. And we need to take those type of steps. This president has seen personnel records of people who have sacrificed for the American people and for the federal government stolen by the Chinese and he's done nothing in return. This is why -- this is what I said at the beginning that this administration, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton through their foreign policy, have betrayed the American people, because the weakness they've displayed has led to Putin's incursions in the Middle East and in eastern Europe, and has led -- has led to significant problems in the Middle East as well, and the death and murder of lots of folks."}}
{'debate': u'05', 'candidate': u'FIORINA', 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u'Hillary Clinton has gotten every foreign policy challenge wrong. Hitting the reset button with Vladimir Putin - recall that she called Bashar Al-Assad a positive reformer and then she opened an embassy and then later she said, over, and over, and over again, "Bashar Al-Assad must go." Although she wasn\'t prepared to do anything about it. Recall that Hillary Clinton was all for toppling Gadhafi then didn\'t listen to her own people on the ground. And then of course, when she lied about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, she invited more terrorist attacks.'}}
{'debate': u'5', 'candidate': u'CLINTON', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u"We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East. They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria. They want to hang on to that. I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and I'm glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense. We've got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so they're actually contributing more to their own defense."}}
{'debate': u'05', 'candidate': u'FIORINA', 'sentences': {'category': u'positive', 'text': u"I know Vladimir Putin. He respects strength. He lied to our president's face; didn't both to tell him about warplanes and troops going into Syria. We need to speak to him from a position of strength. So as commander in chief, I will not speak to him until we've set up that no-fly zone; until we've gathered our Sunni-Arab allies and begun to deny ISIS territory; until I've called the supreme leader of Iran and told him new deal -- new deal. We the United States of America are going to cut off the money flow, which we can do; which we don't need anyone's permission or collaboration to do."}}
{'debate': u'09', 'candidate': u'RUBIO', 'sentences': {'category': u'negative', 'text': u' No. I think there are three major threats that you want to immediately get on top of. Number one is, what are we doing in the Asia Pacific region, where both North Korea and China pose threats to the national security of the United States. Number two is, what are we doing in the Middle East with the combination of the Sunni/Shia conflict driven by the Shia Arc, that Iran is now trying to establish in the Middle East and also the growing threat of ISIS. And the third is rebuilding and reinvigorating NATO in the European theater, particularly in Central Europe and in Eastern Europe, where Vladimir Putin is now threatening the territor-- the territory of multiple countries, already controls 20% of Georgia, and a significant percentage of Ukraine.'}}
